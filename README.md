# phish_analytics
Phanalytix is a project based on the creation of an original dataset based off of three APIs, phish.in, phish.net, and the Google Maps API.  The dataset is a compilation of the shows and songs data of the band Phish.  There is also a Shiny App, involving two components that can be used by Phish fans and explorers.
