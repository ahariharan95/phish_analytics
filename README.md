## Phanalytix: An Analysis of the Shows and Songs Data of the Band Phish

The main purpose of this project is to create and analyze a dataset compiling information about the shows and songs performed by the band Phish from 1983 to 2017.  Phish is an American rock band, founded in the University of Vermont in 1983 and known for musical improvisation, extended jams, and blending of genres.  With their huge and dedicated fan base, there are multiple websites that have been created, documenting their songs, shows, and tours.  Therefore, this project is based on the compilation of all of the information available, mainly from Phish.in and Phish.net, into one large dataset.  The three main resources for the creation of this dataset were Phish.in, Phish.net, and Google Maps' API.  Through web-scraping and data cleaning, phanalytix.csv was created, comprising of 31 variables and 30,883 observations.  In addition to the csv, a Shiny app, Phanylytix, was also created as a part of the project, allowing users to interact with the data.  The app has two components, "Find a Show" and "Show Map". 

The completion of this project involved the efforts of countless hours of research, hardwork, and troubleshooting by Aishwarya Hariharan and two more students from the STOR 390: Introduction to Data Science class at the Univeristy of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, along with the coursework/lectures and guidance from the course instructor, Iain Carmichael.
